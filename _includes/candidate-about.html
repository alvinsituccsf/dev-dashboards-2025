    <h2>About this page</h2>
    <p>
        State and local laws require candidates to publicly report the financial activity of their campaign committee. This includes the names of individuals who contribute $100 or more in a calendar year and how funds are spent. Candidates who participate in San Francisco’s Public Financing Program can receive matching City funds for contributions from local residents. In addition, third-party committees may raise and spend money to support or oppose a candidate, as long as their activity is not coordinated with the candidate’s campaign.
